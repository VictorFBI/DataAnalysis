# DataAnalysis
Repository for storing all home assignments and projects from the HSE SE course "Data analysis in Python"
## HW 1
The task was to open AppleStore.csv file and answer some questions to do analysis of the file contents. Additionally, it was necessary to form 10 own questions distinguishing from those already in the file to do additional analysis of the file contents. The task was done in affiliation with [Pavel Glebov](https://github.com/psok712)
## HW 2
The task was to open AppleStore.csv file and answer some questions to do analysis of the file contents (topics: chi2 contingency,  kstest, shapiro test, normaltest, partitial correlation). Quotients are in the notebook, written in Russian. The task was done in affiliation with [Pavel Glebov](https://github.com/psok712)
## HW 3
The task was to open Worldbank_tech.xlsx and Video_Games_Sales.csv files and complete 2 tasks connected with cluster anaylysis. Also it was necessary to describe the resulting clusters by means of descriptive statistics. Quotients and descriptions are in the notebook, written in Russian. The task was done in affiliation with [Pavel Glebov](https://github.com/psok712)
## HW 4
The task was to open IT_Salary_Survey_EU_2020.csv file and complete the task connected with linear regression. Also it was necessary to describe the results (coefficients of linerar regression, characteristics of model and etc). Quotients and descriptions are in the notebook, written in Russian. The task was done in affiliation with [Pavel Glebov](https://github.com/psok712)
## HW 5
The task was to open bank-additional-full.csv file and complete the task connected with binary logistic regression. Also it was necessary to properly describe the results (coefficients of regression, characteristics of model and etc). Quotients and descriptions are in the notebook, written in Russian. The task was done in affiliation with [Pavel Glebov](https://github.com/psok712)
## HW 6 
The task was to retrieve information from certain websites by means of **web-scrapping** technique 
## Final project ðŸŽ¯
The task was to find a dataset in the Internet and provide complex analysis of it. It includes testing statistical hypotheses (chi2_contingency test, kstest), descriptive analysis, plotting and describing built plots, building the linear and binary logistic regression with proper description of these models (statistical significance, R^2, coefficients, etc) and cluster analysis with detailed description of each cluster. Finally, decent description of results of the work done had to be provided. What hypotheses are accepted? Which of them are declined? Etc. The second part was to build a dataset with more than 100 observations by means of **web-scrapping** technique, while parsing more than 200 webpages. All stages of the work and all results had to be summarized in presentation. The task was done in affiliation with [Pavel Glebov](https://github.com/psok712)
